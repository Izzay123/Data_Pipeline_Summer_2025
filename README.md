A data pipeline project built for the [Learn Analytics Engineering Data Pipeline Summer](https://learnanalyticsengineering.substack.com/t/data-pipeline-summer) challenge.

## About

This project is my attempt to get hands-on experience with analytics engineering concepts while exploring SQLMesh as an alternative to dbt. As someone who just started using dbt at work, I wanted to learn how SQLMesh approaches data modeling and pipeline orchestration. I am fairly new to the tools and concepts this year. 

## Tech Stack

- **DuckDB** - Local analytics database
- **SQLMesh** - Data transformation and modeling framework  
- **MotherDuck** - Cloud-native DuckDB platform

## Status

Work in Progress** - This project is actively being developed as part of the summer challenge. Admittedly, I'm a couple weeks behind as of Sep 1, 2025. Got the local db spun up and the seeds and staging models built out. 

## Goals

- Learn SQLMesh fundamentals and compare with dbt workflows
- Apply analytics engineering best practices to real data
- Pick up better habits around data modelling
- Build a complete data pipeline from ingestion to analysis
